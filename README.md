# Advent of Code [Rust]

This is my first time working on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

From the [about page](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about):

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

This repository contains the projects I created and resources used to get my answers.
